# Registry Pattern vs Switch Statements: Performance Experiments

Swift playground comparing registry patterns vs switch statements for iOS form field creation.

## Quick Start

1. Download and open `RegistryPatternExperiments.playground` in Xcode
2. Run the performance comparison:
   ```swift
   let tester = FormFieldCreationPerformanceTester()
   tester.runPerformanceComparison()
   
   let memoryAnalyzer = MemoryAnalyzer()
   memoryAnalyzer.runCompleteMemoryAnalysis()
   ```

## Key Findings

- **Performance**: Registry pattern 3-5% faster than switch statements
- **Memory**: 36% less memory usage at scale (244MB vs 381MB for 1M fields)
- **Architecture**: Eliminates team coordination issues and follow SOLID principles

## 📚 Blog Post

This playground accompanies my detailed analysis: [Registry Pattern Experiments: The Technical Deep Dive](your-blog-link)

## 🎯 What's Tested

- Switch-based vs registry-based field creation
- Performance across different scales (10k, 100k, 1M iterations)
- Memory usage comparison

## 🚀 Experiment & Contribute

Feel free to:
- **Modify iteration counts** to test different scales
- **Add your own field types** to the registry
- **Test different registry approaches** 
- **Share your findings** via issues or discussions
- **Fork and extend** for your own experiments

## ⚙️ Requirements

- Xcode 12.0+
- macOS (for memory measurement)
